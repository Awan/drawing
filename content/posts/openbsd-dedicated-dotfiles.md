### OpenBSD as new OS
I keep my dotfiles on Github/Gitlab. I had to configure many things so I started 
a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/Awan/dot.git).

### New Dotfiles

I created a new directory `dot` in my `home dir`. And cherry picked some of my 
old dots.
I have pushed my new `dot` directory to Git[hub,lab] as [Awan,Abdullah]/dot 
respectively. 

### Old Linux dotfiles

Linux users still can find my dotfiles on 
[Github](https://github.com/Awan/dot.git) and 
[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/Abdullah/dot.git).
