A picture is worth 1000 words. Working with github repos, sometimes you want to
include a screenshot in your repos. Today I'll help you getting this done in one
step.

Go to your repo page and click on issues.

Click new issue

Take a screenshot you wanna add and paste it there using Control + V or whatever
you like.


You will get a link once the screenshot is uploaded. Just copy it and paste it
in your README.md

Close the page 'new issue', you don't need to create an issue.

Commit and push changes. Done.
